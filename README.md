# PixiTales-ScriptableObject-Inventory

Can swap, merge, stack, or use items. Drag items to the trashcan to delete. Can save/load and sort items. Doesn't delete your inventory when you change scenes.

Special thanks to Inscope, Coding with unity, and Ashfid on Discord

These are my own sprites that I made, do not steal!!!
